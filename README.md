## Project 5: Neighborhood Map

### Description of The Project

>You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

>The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

### Project Files

The project contains three (3) types of files - * **html**, **css** and **js** *:

#### 1. HTML
- **index.html** - contains the page layout and binds all the js and css files together to make the page operational.

#### 2. CSS
- **styles.css** - contains the custom styles for the page.

#### 3. JS

- **app.js** - this is the main js file that is the backbone of the map.  It contains all the javascript code for the app to work correctly.
- **custom.js** - this file handles the sidebar open and closing effect.
- **features.js** - contains the custom map features to style the map.
- **locations.js** - contains all of the location information not gathered from the foursquare api.
